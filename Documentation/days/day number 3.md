day number 3
we started off as usual not knowing what were getting into...
first we research aspect ratio for the game, snes uses 4:3 so we went with that instead of modern 16:9
but than we haD a lot of extra space, so I was brainstorming what should we do with that REALESTATE...
We landed on making a level editor, so i researched mario maker.
Their level design was charming and got the job done but I wanted something more functional.
so the design we selected was a pallete system inspired by paint, and the different palletes will items, enemies and objects from the game.

Day 3 today we make a mario level editor inspired by paint.
-we started the day confused as heck, as always.
-first we research aspect ratio for the game, snes uses 4:3 so we went with that instead of modern 16:9
-this leaves beautiful black gutters on modern screen sizes!
-but my art teacher taught me to always fill in blank space, so i did just that.
-and ofc i had to keep it functional because im that type of guy
-so i began researching mario maker 2, so cool btw.
-Their level design was charming and got the job done but I wanted something more functional.
-so I opted for a microsoft paint inspired design
-intead of selecting colors, you select objects and paint on the game canvas like picasso
-the palletes will be organized by object types instead of colors
-think - terrain, blocks, monsters, items
-smb3 is played on a 32x30 game grids consisting of 16x16 sprites
-the grid populated as you progressed through the game, the optimization of the game was beatiful, 
-and we added a text to block feature because that's actually a necessary function for mario games!
-tomorrow we will be hosting the game which will be more like a 2d minecraft that you can edit the sandbox together!
-I really appreciated the massive support in these first 2 days. Y'all are the real ones and keep me going!!!
