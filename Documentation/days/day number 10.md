🎮 playfree.dev — Layered sky-to-core parallax + longitude compass

Big picture: The world now renders stacked atmospheric/space/underground layers with bespoke art and a compass-driven endless loop so everyone shares the same wraparound planet.

— Vertical layers
— Added 10 altitude bands (Deep Space -> Deep Underground) with gradient backdrops, PNG art, and per-layer parallax motifs.
— Layer index anchored to spawn; HUD pill and debug overlay show band names and boundaries.
— Level padded with 8 screens of sky and extended underground so you can climb/fall across layers.

— Longitude loop
— Endless world wraps every 360° with a degree-aware compass overlay; shows current heading + biome.
— Biome bands tune endless generator weights and show in the endless debug overlay.
— Shared global seed + wrap-safe camera math keep everyone synced.

— Assets & polish
— New layer art set in assets/layers plus parallax motifs (stars, nebulae, clouds, hills, roots, cracks, lava).
— Canvas/HUD scaling keeps backgrounds aligned at any viewport scale.

— Tomorrow
— Add transitions/weather per layer, altitude-specific hazards, and warp gates between surface and space.
